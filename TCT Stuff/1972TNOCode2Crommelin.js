The immediate aftermath of election day is chaotic, liberals, conservatives, and your very own Vanguardist are taking to the streets to celebrate, protest, and riot respectively. The election will most certainly go to the House, and you have no chance of winning for you as noone would be willing to support you when there are several alternatives.</p><p> Eventually, after enough backroom deals, a deal is made between Progressives, Democrats, and Republicans, and Senator George McGovern of South Dakota who had previously lost the RDC nomination is hoisted into the Presidency as a compromise, sparking relief within the nation from moderates..</p>`,

Even then, what of the NPP? Hall's gambit paid off, he won, and the Progressives and Marxist and held and gained seats in Congress respectively, and that has given Hall considerable sway in the NPP. If you had lost, things might have turned out better for you as Hall would be irrelevant, his gambit having failed, but no matter.</p><p>The Vanguard is alive, for the most part. Byers retained his seat in the House, Crommelin was running for the Senate whilst campaigning with you and has emerged victorious, attaining victory. Even then, the closeness of this election definitely means that the Marxists will be at the forefront of the NPP until 1976, perhaps Hall could run then unless you something comes out which sinks his candidacy</p>`,
            `<p>Ultimately, future generations will remember this election for how bizzare it was. The issues at hand during it, the riots, the economy, the radicalism, and its dramatic conclusion. You will have inspired countless of your ilk to take up the mantle and to carry on your legacy, Hall has done the same, being remembered as a dangerous demagogue spoken in the same breathe as you and Adolf Hitler, or a champion of the sensible voter when there was none to fight for them, to give them a voice. Ultimately, your legacy will be that of a demagogue who accidentally revived liberalism, and future generations will study this election for years to come.</p>`
